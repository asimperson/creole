Bonus Patches (09.01.09 - Maxious <maxious@lambdacomplex.org>)

Releases of Carrier now include some extra patches that are not applied 
directly to the source code as is. Some users may wish to use an 
unmodified libpurple for distribution or stablility reasons.

To use the patch series, you must have the quilt tool which is 
available at http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt or through most
package managers.

You then do a "quilt push -a", "sh autogen.sh" and compile as usual.
