carrier is a fork of pidgin, instigated by pidgin's decision to remove some UI customization features
(most notably, the ability to resize the text input box). However, the fork has not been updated in four years, which
means it is missing bug fixes and other updates from pidgin.

The goal of this repository is currently to reverse-engineer the patches the carrier developers used. The pidgin released
source is likely too new to do a straight update, so I first need to get an idea of what makes carrier carrier. Once I
have a set of patches, I should be able to update to pidgin latest, re-apply the patches, and then proceed.

I'm calling my continuation "creole", which in lingustic terms is a pidgin that has begun to be spoken as a mother tongue.
